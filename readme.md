# Web Front-end practise

This assignment was performed in order to understand how to make a Front-end prototype. The website is called Sogyo Adventure is lets you buy tickets for amusement parks that this company supports, but only if tickets are available. Since this assignment focused solely on the front-end, the only part which was altered by me is the 'client' folder. The program uses html, css and javascript.

This assignment is not entirely done yet, but the website should run as wanted.
